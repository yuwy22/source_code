What programming language did you use to write your code? Java

Does your program compile on ix: Yes

How should we compile your program on ix (please provide short but specific commands): 
$ javac ManyRandomWalk.java
$ java ManyRandomWalk input_file output_file round_Num
(for instance: $ java ManyRandomWalk fl_undir.tab.txt out.txt 30)

java ManyRandomWalk /cs/classes/www/14S/cis630/or_undir.tab output0514.txt 5


Does your program run on ix: Yes

Does your program have a limit for the number of nodes in the input graph? 
Yes
If yes, what is the limit on graph size that your program can handle?
2,000,000 nodes and no limit on the size of edges (actually the size of the nodes can be easily changed in the source code)

How long does it take for your program to read the input file on ix? 
55 seconds

How long does it take for your program (on average) to complete each round of processing on ix? 
2-4 seconds

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Below is one sample output on the screen if I run my code at ix using ($ java ManyRandomWalk fl_undir.tab.txt out.txt 30):

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The name of input file is fl_undir.tab.txt
The name of output file is out.txt
Round Number is 30

Begin to read input file...
Time to read input file = 55 seconds

The time for completing each round (including updating the output file):
Writing Round 1 = 2 seconds
Writing Round 2 = 3 seconds
Writing Round 3 = 3 seconds
Writing Round 4 = 3 seconds
Writing Round 5 = 4 seconds
Writing Round 6 = 4 seconds
Writing Round 7 = 3 seconds
Writing Round 8 = 3 seconds
Writing Round 9 = 3 seconds
Writing Round 10 = 3 seconds
Writing Round 11 = 3 seconds
Writing Round 12 = 3 seconds
Writing Round 13 = 3 seconds
Writing Round 14 = 3 seconds
Writing Round 15 = 2 seconds
Writing Round 16 = 3 seconds
Writing Round 17 = 3 seconds
Writing Round 18 = 3 seconds
Writing Round 19 = 3 seconds
Writing Round 20 = 4 seconds
Writing Round 21 = 2 seconds
Writing Round 22 = 3 seconds
Writing Round 23 = 3 seconds
Writing Round 24 = 3 seconds
Writing Round 25 = 3 seconds
Writing Round 26 = 3 seconds
Writing Round 27 = 2 seconds
Writing Round 28 = 4 seconds
Writing Round 29 = 3 seconds
Writing Round 30 = 3 seconds

Right now, the data of total 30 rounds are writing to the output file.....
Writing total 30 Rounds to output file takes 179 seconds

This program has finished, please check the output file.
